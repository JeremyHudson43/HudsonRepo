Hello, and welcome to my GitHub. I've written the following programs for fun and to practice my programming skills. My work is organized by folder, please read below for more information. 

 ## Java Swing
``Library Management System`` - My most detailed project that simulates functions of a librarian. These include check-in, check out, managing customers, and looking up and maintaining books. Implements the Google Books API and a local MySQL database. A more detailed description can be found under docs inside the Library Management System folder. 

 ## Java
``ReverseRecursion`` - reverses a word using a recursive StringBuffer algorithm

``GreenGlassWorld`` - determines if a string inputted by the user has two consecutive letters of the same kind, for example "lettuce" will be in the Green Glass World because of the two consecutive "t"'s, however "vegetable" will not be in the Green Glass world.

``NQueensProblem`` - will place a set number of queens on a generated chessboard in such a manner that no queen attacks another queen, demonstrating a backtracking algorithm.  

``TwoPlayerChess`` - simulates a game of chess between two human players using chess notation. 

``AVL_Tree`` - an implementation of an AVL tree in java that will rotate nodes as they are inserted, and when all nodes have been inserted it will show the heights and balance factors of the nodes with an in-order traversal. 

``PushdownAutomata`` - simulates a deterministic pushdown automata given an input from a text file.

 ## IPython Notebooks
``HellingerCalculator`` - uses the Hellinger distance to determine the similarity between two bodies of text using LDA models.

``MeanOfBigramQuantity`` - finds the average occurences of certain bigrams (word pairs) to determine topic discussion freqeuncy.

``NLTKGensimHybrid`` -  used to produce topic models using processed data from the NLTK that produces an LDA model using Gensim modules.

``BigramFinder`` - simply finds all occurences of bigrams in a text document and prints them to an excel notebook. 

 ## Python
``Transcriber`` - implements the Google Speech To Text API to convert a .FLAC file to a text transcription.
