# HudsonRep
Hello, and welcome to my GitHub. I've written the following programs for fun and to practice my programming skills. My work is organized by folder, please read below for more information. 

 ## Java Swing
``Library Management System`` - My most detailed project that simulates functions of a librarian. These include check-in, check out, managing customers, and looking up and maintaining books. Implements the Google Books API and a local MySQL database. This project was designed as part of a group project, but the code I wrote is clearly labeled at the top of each Java file. A more detailed description can be found under docs inside the Library Management System folder. 

 ## SQL / PHP
``Sample Company Database`` - Simulates a simple company database implementing SQL and using PHP as a backend. 

The project is at the following link, although foreign key constraints may not work due to the hosting service using an old version of SQL:

## Java

``Network Simulator`` - Simulates the transmission of a packet across a network. Currently implements a fully functioning TCP packet with complete checksum calculation. 


 ## IPython Notebooks
``HellingerCalculator`` - uses the Hellinger distance to determine the similarity between two bodies of text using LDA models.

``MeanOfBigramQuantity`` - finds the average occurences of certain bigrams (word pairs) to determine topic discussion freqeuncy.

``NLTKGensimHybrid`` -  used to create Gensim LDA topic models using processed data from the Natural Language Toolkit

``BigramFinder`` - simply finds all occurences of bigrams in a text document and prints them to an excel notebook.
