# HudsonRepo
Hello, and welcome to my GitHub. I've written the following programs for fun and to practice my programming skills. My work is organized by folder, please read below for more information. 

 ## Java Swing
``Library Management System`` - My most detailed project that simulates functions of a librarian. These include check-in, check out, managing customers, and looking up and maintaining books. Implements the Google Books API and a local MySQL database. 

This project was designed as part of a group project, but the code I wrote is clearly labeled at the top of each Java file. A more detailed description can be found under docs inside the Library Management System folder. 

 ## SQL / PHP
``Sample Company Database`` - Simulates a simple company database implementing SQL and using PHP as a backend. Feel free to add and edit values yourself. 

The project is at the following link, although foreign key constraints / birthday verification may not work due to the hosting service using an old version of SQL:

 ## Python 
 
``Text Analysis Program`` - Uses a variety of natural language processing techniques to analyze a collection of text files. These include a few implementations of LDA models, TF-IDF models, bigrams, raw word frequency and deep learning using Top2Vec. 

Results from running the program on the King James Bible can be found in the "Results" folder inside the "Text Analysis Program" folder.
