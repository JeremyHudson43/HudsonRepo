Hello, and welcome to my GitHub. I've written the following programs for fun and to practice my programming skills. 

reverseRecursion reverses a word using a recursive StringBuffer algorithm

Green Glass World will determine if a string inputted by the user has two consecutive letters of the same kind, for example "lettuce" will be in the Green Glass World because of the two consecutive "t"'s, however "vegetable" will not be in the Green Glass world.

nQueensProblem will place a set number of queens on a generated chessboard in such a manner that no queen attacks another queen, demonstrating a backtracking algorithm.  

twoPlayerChess simulates a game of chess between two human players using chess notation. Rules have not been programmed in.
