Hello, and welcome to my GitHub. I've written the following programs for fun and to practice my programming skills. 

reverseRecursion reverses a word using a recursive StringBuffer algorithm

Green Glass World will determine if a string inputted by the user has two consecutive letters of the same kind, for example "lettuce" will be in the Green Glass World because of the two consecutive "t"'s, however "vegetable" will not be in the Green Glass world.

nQueensProblem will place a set number of queens on a generated chessboard in such a manner that no queen attacks another queen, demonstrating a backtracking algorithm.  

twoPlayerChess simulates a game of chess between two human players using chess notation. Rules have not been programmed in. 

AVL_Tree is an implementation of an AVL tree in java that will rotate nodes as they are inserted, and when all nodes have been inserted it will show the heights and balance factors of the nodes with an in-order traversal. 

A more detailed description of the Library Management System can be found in the Requirements documents under the docs folder in the Library Management System Folder.
